# AllOfOld

Nothing else ever. Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better. 
                                                        -Sanmuel Beckett, Worstword Ho

## Repo contents
This repo contains the lilypond files and python scripts needed to generate notated material, build score and generate a pdf for this piano quartet.

## Structure
There are three different types of material used in the piece for ease of description, Iâ€™ll use simple primary color names to explain the types. The recurrence of a particular type of material is based on permutations of a pitch class. These permutations arise from two transposition paths (m3-p4-m6, p4-m6-j2-j6), having traced out these paths, it becomes clear how often a particular class of pitch recurs. To emphasise the fact that some pitches recur more frequently than others, the instrumentation is designed in a way so as to emphasize different colorings of pitch. 
The piece therefore is not really about the pitches themselves, but rather about the sound of transitioning between the different instrumental colors.
